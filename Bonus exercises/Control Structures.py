#Control Structures: 
#Imagine an alien was just shot down in a game. Create a variable called alien_color and 
#assign it a value of 'green', 'yellow', or 'red'. 
#•Write an if statement to test whether the alien’s color is green. If it is, print a message 
#that the player just earned 5 points. 
#•Write one version of this program that passes the if test and another that fails. (The 
#version that fails will have no output.)

# Assigning the alien's color green
alien_color = "green"

# If statement to check the alien's color
if alien_color == "green" :
    print("You earned 5 point!")

# Assigning the alien's color yellow
alien_color = "yellow"

# If statement to check the alien's color
if alien_color == "green" :
    print("You earned 5 point!")
